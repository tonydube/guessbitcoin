        Welcome to Our Prediction Platform! üåü
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        Here's how the rewards work and how you can earn points for your
        accurate Bitcoin price predictions.

        How Points Work
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        Every time you make a prediction, you have the chance to earn points
        based on how close your guess is to the actual closing price of Bitcoin
        for that day. The closer your prediction, the more points you‚Äôll earn!
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="h5" gutterBottom>
        Rules for Predictions
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        <strong>No Last-Minute Guesses:</strong> You cannot make a guess within
        24 hours of the closing price.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
        Example: If the closing price for January 15th will be calculated at
        11:59 PM UTC, your last chance to submit a prediction for that date is
        January 14th at 11:59 PM UTC.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        <strong>No Edits Close to the Deadline:</strong> Predictions cannot be
        edited within 24 hours of the closing price. Once your prediction is
        locked, it‚Äôs final‚Äîno changes allowed.

        Time Bonus ‚è≥
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        The earlier you make your prediction, the more bonus points you‚Äôll earn.
        Why? Because making accurate long-term predictions is much harder than
        short-term guesses! For each day between when you make your prediction
        and the closing date, your points are multiplied by a 5% daily bonus.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
        Example: If you make a prediction 30 days in advance and hit an Exact
        Match, you‚Äôll earn 43,200 points! Predict just 5 days early and hit a
        Far Match? That‚Äôs 262.5 points with the bonus.
